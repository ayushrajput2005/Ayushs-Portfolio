# Ayush's First Portfolio  

## Introduction  
Hello! My name is Ayush, and this is my very first portfolio. I built it using pure **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, without any frameworks. It's a simple, static webpage with some visual effects, background music, text, and images.  

## Features  
- **No frameworks** â€“ Just the classic HTML, CSS, and JS trio.  
- **Simple animations** â€“ Achieved using CSS.  
- **Background Music & Effects** â€“ Adds an atmospheric touch.  
- **Minimal yet stylish design** â€“ Inspired by game menus and indie aesthetics.  

## Future Updates  
This portfolio marks my **first step** in web development, but it's just the beginning. As I **learn and grow**, I'll update it with better designs, improved features, and new projects.  

## Acknowledgments  
This website is a **non-commercial project**, built purely for learning and self-expression. All images, effects, and assets belong to their respective owners. I support **official releases** and encourage others to do the same.
